# Vetercek.com weather station
Here are some of the 3d prints I use for weather station. As of now I don't print station enclosure because it's not 100% waterproof. I do print bunch of accessories which do help a lot and make WS look more proffesional. I reccomend using ASA material for longer outdoor life cycle 

## Things I print
+ encloser holder for pole mounting 115x90 (two variants, one with holes on top, one on the side)
+ solar panel holder for pole mount (136x110 solar panel)
+ Stevenson screen for temperature sensor
